        <h1 class="h1intro">A Beginning</h1>
      
<p id="intro">Paula Scher's influence over the past several decades of graphic design cannot be understated. In a speaker profile, TED described her as a <i>&ldquo;master conjurer of the instantly familiar&rdquo;</i> due to her wealth of experience designing iconic identities for global brands.</p>
                <hr></hr>
<p>Scher was born in 1948 in Virginia and grew up in Philadelphia and Washington DC. During High School, she embraced Art, stating that it was <i>&ldquo;the first place where I felt like I actually belonged&rdquo;</i> and she became a publicity chairman for her school, designing posters and pamphlets for school dances and events.</p>

<p>She continued her enthusiasm with the arts and took up night classes Corcoran College of Art + Design. This would continue and would result in her applying to the Tyler School of Art. Her mother was less than supportive of Scher's interest in the arts and insisted Paula obtained a certificate in teaching so she had something to fall back on.</p>

<p>Scher attended college in 1966, and initially expected to become a painter but admitted that she couldnâ€™t really draw and as a result she experimented with both metal working and print work. She came away from both feeling like she wasn't good at anything before discovering she had an affinity for graphic design in her junior year.</p> 

<p>She graduated in 1970 and against her mother's advice (who said it would require talent) moved to New York City, where she was employed to design the insides of children's books.</p>

<p><span class="pend">Paula Scher would go on to become an incredibly influential designer, with her work winning dozens of awards and being featured in numerous museums including the <a href="http://www.moma.org/">New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)</a> and the <a href="http://www.philamuseum.org">Philadelphia Museum of Art.</a></p>

                <h1 class="h1career">Her Career</h1>
        
        <p>Scher's first major role in New York was with CBS Records in 1972. She initially joined CBS as part of the publicity team and wasn't involved with the design of album covers, which is what she wanted to do. She left CBS a year later, and joined Atlantic Records where she worked for a year designing various album covers and promotional materials.  However, when she was 25 she returned to CBS Records to become their new Art Director for the East Coast.</p>

        <p>For the next decade, Paula Scher would design almost 150 record covers each year and countless more ads and posters. She designed her album covers using imagery from popular culture, in an effort to engage with the audience and make them more inclined to buy the record. <em>Ellen Lupton</em>, a Curator at Cooper-Hewitt would describe her work as &ldquo;accessible but smart&rdquo; commenting that Scher preferred to invoke a mood or mysterious scenario than literal depictions of bands.</p>

        <p>Her experiences with both CBS and Atlantic Records would leave her with a longstanding fascination for the internal power structures within large corporations, especially when it comes to in-house design teams determining how a job gets commissioned and completed.</p>

        <p>She also quickly learned how best to present her work to clients. If she couldn't sell her work to her recording artists, she couldn't get it made, so she quickly became aware of how best to pitch ideas and explain her thinking.</p>

        <p>In 1982, after growing tired of the music industry, Paula Scher left to form her own design agency (Koppel & Scher) with an old friend, Terry Koppel who at the time was a magazine designer. Together they produced brand identities, product packaging and book covers.</p>

        <p>Her most controversial piece during this period, was a poster for Swatch Watches. The marketing director of the Swiss firm asked Scher and Koppel to produce a poster that was reminiscent of 1950's America.</p>

        <p>Scher's poster has gained a legacy and a spot in the AIGA Medalists 2001 collection. The poster featured a female skier, brandishing two Swatch watches on her arm against a Winter backdrop. For most, this would portray Swatch watches as an easy-going and fun accessory. However, for design students the poster was familiar.</p> 
        
                
        
        <div class="posters">
        <div class="swatch1"><img src="img/swatch.jpg"></div>
        <div class="swatch2"><img src="img/swatch2.png"></div>
        </div>
        

    <p>Paula Scher had based the new campaign on a range of pieces by Herbert Matter, including the poster he designed in the 1930's for the Swiss National Tourist Office. The poster's were intended as a parody, a light-hearted nod at the past, again reflecting Swatch's playful side. She noted herself, &ldquo;This poster was a visual joke, a parody of a famous poster by Herbert Matter.&rdquo;</p>    

<p>The poster's release was followed with harsh debate, with many academics and students would debate the use of nostalgic designs being 'reused' for modern pieces. Many would agree that Scher's work was just parody, but others had a less favourable outlook and and labelled it plagerism.  Nevertheless, whether critics loved or hated the poster, it became a hit for Paula Scher and has become one of her most memorable works.</p>

        <p>The years that followed would prove tough on America, with the Gulf War beginning in 1990, and with it came a recession. This marked the end of Scher and Koppel, with the two finding themselves at a loose-end due to the lack of work.</p>

        <p>Woody Pirtle, a partner at Pentagram invited Scher for coffee and asked if she would be interested in joining. She joined them almost immediately after in 1991, and has stayed there ever since. Since joining Pentagram she has designed identities (Citibank, Microsoft), exhibitions (US Holocaust Memorial Museum) and editorial design (Metropolis).</p>
