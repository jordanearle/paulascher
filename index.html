<p id="intro">Paula Scher's influence over the past several decades of graphic design cannot be understated. In a speaker profile, TED described her as a <i>&ldquo;master conjurer of the instantly familiar&rdquo;</i> due to her wealth of experience designing iconic identities for global brands.</p>
        
        <hr></hr>

<p>Scher was born in 1948 in Virginia and grew up in Philadelphia and Washington DC. During High School, she embraced Art, stating that it was <i>&ldquo;the first place where I felt like I actually belonged&rdquo;</i> and she became a publicity chairman for her school, designing posters and pamphlets for school dances and events.</p>

<p>She continued her enthusiasm with the arts and took up night classes Corcoran College of Art + Design. This would continue and would result in her applying to the Tyler School of Art. Her mother was less than supportive of Scher's interest in the arts and insisted Paula obtained a certificate in teaching so she had something to fall back on.</p>

<p>Scher attended college in 1966, and initially expected to become a painter but admitted that she couldnâ€™t really draw and as a result she experimented with both metal working and print work. She came away from both feeling like she wasn't good at anything before discovering she had an affinity for graphic design in her junior year.</p> 

<p>She graduated in 1970 and against her mother's advice (who said it would require talent) moved to New York City, where she was employed to design the insides of children's books.</p>

<p><span class="pend">Paula Scher would go on to become an incredibly influential designer, with her work winning dozens of awards and being featured in numerous museums including the <a href="http://www.moma.org/">New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)</a> and the <a href="http://www.philamuseum.org">Philadelphia Museum of Art.</a></p>
